\subsection*{Projects}

\begin{description}
  \item[\href{https://computing-workshop.com/}{Computing Workshop.}]
    My partner and I create and run workshops on computer science. We have taught the most recent
    one, an introduction to machine learning in Python, a total of six times as a co-curricular
    activity at McGill University. Our materials are all available online
    \url{https://computing-workshop.com/}

  % \item[Haskell libraries.]
  %   I maintain a pair of
  %   \href{https://github.com/tsani/pushbullet-hs}{Haskell libraries}
  %   (\texttt{pushbullet-types}, \texttt{servant-pushbullet-client}) for
  %   interacting with the \href{https://pushbullet.com}{PushBullet} API.
  %   I also maintain
  %   \href{https://github.com/tsani/servant-github-webhook}{servant-github-webhook},
  %   a library to securely integrate GitHub webhooks with the Servant REST
  %   framework.

  % \item[Fast accumulator startup.]
  %   In a 10-week internship at 1010data in New York City, I worked to
  %   accelerate the core platform login.
  %   My work achieves this by introducing a caching mechanism:
  %   new user session processes are now started via forking.
  %   This mechanism is built as a C extension to the K interpreter, and includes
  %   a framework for reparenting terminal applications to facilitate debugging.
